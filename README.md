# 🎶 SonicPay – Payments Over Sound Waves

> **No NFC. No extra hardware. Just sound.**  
SonicPay transforms any phone into a payment device by using **encrypted sound waves** to transmit transactions between customers and merchants.

## 🌟 Why SonicPay?

- 💡 **Truly Universal** – Works on *any* device with a speaker & mic. No need for NFC chips or special terminals.  
- 🔒 **Secure by Design** – Transactions are encrypted and verified, making it as safe as card swipes (but cooler).  
- 🚀 **Frictionless Setup** – Customers and merchants use the same app. Just register, log in, and you’re ready.  
- 🌍 **Inclusive** – Designed for markets where NFC-enabled hardware isn’t widespread, empowering small businesses globally.

## 🎬 How It Works

1. **Customer initiates payment**  
   → App generates an **inaudible encrypted sound** that encodes the payment details.  

2. **Merchant listens**  
   → Their device’s microphone picks up the sound and decodes it into transaction data.  

3. **Verification & confirmation**  
   → Both sides see a confirmation in real time.  

✨ It’s like magic, but with math, sound waves, and a touch of hustle.
